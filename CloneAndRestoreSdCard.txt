If you are running Linux then you can use the dd command to make a full backup of the image:

dd if=/dev/sdx of=/path/to/image
or for compression:

dd if=/dev/sdx | gzip > /path/to/image.gz
Where sdx is your SD card.

To restore the backup, you reverse the commands:

dd if=/path/to/image of=/dev/sdx
or when compressed:

gzip -dc /path/to/image.gz | dd of=/dev/sdx
